The Share Extras SDK provides a number of sample projects that you can use as templates to build your own add-ons.

All sample projects share a common folder structure for organising your repository, web-tier and client-side customisations. Apache Ant is used to build and deploy the files in standard formats.

Before you start using the projects, you will want to ensure you have a [Development Environment](DevelopmentEnvironment.md) set up. Most Share Extras projects use Eclipse, and therefore the projects provide Eclipse project definitions for your use, although you are not _required_ to use Eclipse.

The following sample projects are part of the Share Extras SDK

  * The [Sample Project](SampleProject.md) provides an example of a standard web-script-based add-on for Share with optional client-side component, using the example of a custom 'Hello World' dashlet.
  * The [Sample Script Action](SampleScriptAction.md) allows you to easily hook repository-based JavaScript actions into the Share Document Library
  * The [Sample Modules Project](SampleModules.md) provides a collection of Share 4.0 Modules, based on [Dave Draper's excellent tutorials](http://blogs.alfresco.com/wp/ddraper/)
