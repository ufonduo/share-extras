# Introduction #

This project provides a custom dashlet that lists 'expired' content owned by the current user, plus a full-page report implemented as a custom Surf page.

Content is considered to have expired when the value of its `cm:to` date property (part of the out-of-the-box _Effectivity_ aspect) is in the past. Ownership is specified explicitly by the value of the `cm:owner` (part of the out-of-the-box _Ownable_ aspect) property, which should be set the username of the owner.

## Applying Expiration Policies ##

To allow expiration dates to be set automatically based on a simple policy, a custom aspect named _Validity_ is supplied in a custom model. The aspect specifies a _Validity Period_ property value, which defines how long that content item should be considered valid for before a further review is necessary.

Three JavaScript files are provided to manage expiration policies, based on the aspect data. You must download the scripts to your computer and add them to the repository's Data Dictionary/Scripts space in order to use them.

The script [apply-expiration.js](http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Content%20Expiration/config/alfresco/script/apply-expiration.js) is allows a default validity period (3 months) to be set against content items. The script can be run against a single document or against a folder. In the latter case it will recurse through the folder contents and apply the policy to all documents below that level.

In addition to setting the validity period (if not already set), the script also sets the content owner to the user who created the content, and sets an initial expiration date by adding the validity period to the last modified time stamp.

After adding the script to the Data Dictionary/Scripts space, you can run it from the _Run Action_ dialogue in Alfresco Explorer, or using the [ExecuteScriptAction](ExecuteScriptAction.md) add-on. If you want to apply expiration to all documents added below a specific folder then you can set up a rule to automatically run the script against new documents.

After the action has run the Validity Period and Owner can be changed at any time using the _Edit Metadata_ page for the document. The expiration date cannot be set directly, only indirectly via the validity period.

To allow the expiration date to be extended when the document is reviewed, another script [update-expiration.js](http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Content%20Expiration/config/alfresco/script/update-expiration.js) is provided. Like `apply-expiration.js` this can be run on-demand from Explorer or via the [ExecuteScriptAction](ExecuteScriptAction.md) action, but since this will be used more frequently by users you may wish to configure the custom action also supplied (see [#Custom\_Action\_Installation\_(Optional)](#Custom_Action_Installation_(Optional).md), below), which will allow users to run the script with a single click.

![http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Content%20Expiration/screenshots/update-expiration-action.png](http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Content%20Expiration/screenshots/update-expiration-action.png)

Alternatively you can also set up a content rule to execute `update-expiration.js` whenever a user updates the content item. This may be preferable to adding custom actions in some circumstances.

A third script [remove-expiration.js](http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Content%20Expiration/config/alfresco/script/remove-expiration.js) will remove the expiration metadata from a content item that you no longer wish to be managed in this way. You can run this on a document or on a folder to remove the metadata from all documents below that level.

You can also manually remove content expiration metadata from items by using Share's _Manage Aspects_ dialogue, to remove the Validity and Effectivity aspects.

# Installation #

The add-on has been developed to install on top of an existing Alfresco 3.3 or 3.4 installation.

To install the action, drop the `content-expiration.jar` file into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder within your Alfresco installation, and restart the application server. You might need to create this folder if it does not already exist.

## Custom Action Installation (Optional) ##

Once the JAR file has been deployed into your application server, you can need to configure the Share application to display the action.

Firstly, copy the web script configuration file
`WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/documentlibrary/documentlist.get.config.xml`
from the Share webapp into the directory
`alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/documentlibrary` in Tomcatâ€™s `shared/classes` to override it. You should see a section
`<actionSet id="document">` which defines all the actions shown for a normal document in the document list view.

To add the action to this list, add the following line just before the `</actionset>` element for that block.

```
<action type="action-link" id="onActionUpdateExpiration" permission="edit" label="actions.document.update-expiration" />
```

To make the action appear for folder items in addition to documents, add the same line into the section `<actionSet id="folder">`.

If you also want the action to show up in the document details view, you need to copy the file `WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/document-details/document-actions.get.config.xml`
into `alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/document-details` in `shared/classes`, and add the extra `<action>` definition in the same way.

Lastly, you need to ensure that the client-side JS and CSS assets get pulled into the UI as unfortunately the config files do not allow us to specify these dependencies.

To do this, you must override the file
`WEB-INF/classes/alfresco/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/documentlibrary/actions-common.get.head.ftl`. Copy this into the directory `alfresco/web-extension/site-webscripts/org/alfresco/components/documentlibrary` in `shared/classes` and add the following lines at the bottom of the file.

```
<#-- Update Expiration Action -->
<@link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="${page.url.context}/res/extras/components/documentlibrary/update-expiration-action.css" />
<@script type="text/javascript" src="${page.url.context}/res/extras/components/documentlibrary/update-expiration-action.js"></@script>
```

Once you have made these changes you will need to restart Tomcat so that the configuration and your classpath resources in the JAR file are picked up.

Note: If you want the action to appear in the repository browsing pages or in Web Quick Start or DOD sites, you will also need to update the corresponding `.config.xml` and `.head.ftl` files for those page components.

# Building from Source #

Check out the project if you have not already done so

```
svn checkout http://share-extras.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/Content%20Expiration
```

Change into the new directory

```
cd "Content Expiration"
```

An Ant build script is provided to build a JAR file containing the custom files, which can then be installed into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

To build the JAR file, run the following command from the base project directory.

```
ant clean dist-jar
```

The command should build a JAR file named `content-expiration.jar` in the `dist` directory within your project, which you can then copy into the `tomcat/shared/lib` folder of your Alfresco installation.

Alternatively, you can use the build script to _hot deploy_ the JAR file directly into a local Tomcat instance for testing. You will need to use the `hotcopy-tomcat-jar task` and set the `tomcat.home` property in Ant.

```
ant -Dtomcat.home=C:/Alfresco/tomcat clean dist-jar hotcopy-tomcat-jar
```

After you have deployed the JAR file you will need to restart Tomcat to ensure it picks up the changes.

See [#Custom\_Action\_Installation\_(Optional)](#Custom_Action_Installation_(Optional).md), above for the additional steps, which are required after installing the JAR file to configure the optional _Update Expiration_ action into the Document Library.

# Usage #

  1. Log in to Alfresco Share and navigate to your user dashboard.
  1. Click the **Customize Dashboard** button to edit the contents of the dashboard and drag the dashlet into one of the columns from the list of dashlets.
  1. You can view the full report for your expired content items by clicking the **Full Report** link at the top of the dashlet.
  1. Once on the full page, you can change the URL to display the report for another user, or use the username 'all' to display all expired content across all sites.
